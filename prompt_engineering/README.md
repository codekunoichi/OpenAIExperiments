# Overview

The content of this folder are obtained from the course [ChatGPT Prompt Engineering For Developers](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/)

- The course material is downloaded Jupyter Notebook shared during the course.
- Read this [ReadMe](../README.md#get-open-ai-account-and-api-keys) on this Repo to find out how to obtain an API Key, 
- Read [here](../README.md#setup-github-codespaces-to-do-local-development) how to set up the keys for your codespaces to set as an environment variable.
- The output obtained during the run of the code snippet is shared here for illustration purposes. As without an API_KEY the notebook cannot be run. Hence, added the sample output obtained during the run for learning purposes. For each notebook, the output obtained during running the excercise in Deeplearning.ai sandbox, has been attached to the notebook for helping learners see through the output and make sense of the possibility without running the code. This is done to help all people on the fence thinking "I don't know Python, Jupyter Notebook, its not for me"  see through the immense possibility these LLMs have!
- A must do course, its fun, all age groups welcome!

# Course Structure
- The following lecture sections are present, I am adding the run time for the lecture videos, to give learners an overview of time commitments. (Especially to working mothers, pressed for time in the day to steal to further careers!)
- Don't miss the Introduction and Guidelines. The key meta learning is present in the first two lectures. 
- The Iterative, Summarizing, Inferring, Transforming, Expanding - illustrates the capabilities of the LLM and how you can leverage it for your own needs.
- Chatbot Lesson is the most fun one! You see the guiding principles #1(Provide clear instructions), #2(Give model time to think) both in play.
- As of 04.29.2023 the following lecture run times were captured.
- You can see 2 hours of investment, will leave you wiser and appreciative of what these LLMs are capable of!
1. Introduction - 6 min
2. Guideines - 17 min
3. Iterative - 13 min
4. Summarizing - 7 min
5. Inferring - 12 min
6. Transforming - 12 min
7. Expading - 6 min
8. Chatbot - 12 min
