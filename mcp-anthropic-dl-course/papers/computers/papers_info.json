    "summary": "What is called \"numerical reproducibility\" is the problem of getting the same result when the scientific computation is run several times, either on the same machine or on different machines, with different types and numbers of processing units, execution environments, computational loads etc. This problem is especially stringent for HPC numerical simulations. In what follows, the focus is on parallel implementations of interval arithmetic using floating-point arithmetic. For interval computations, numerical reproducibility is of course an issue for testing and debugging purposes. However, as long as the computed result encloses the exact and unknown result, the inclusion property, which is the main property of interval arithmetic, is satisfied and getting bit for bit identical results may not be crucial. Still, implementation issues may invalidate the inclusion property. Several ways to preserve the inclusion property are presented, on the example of the product of matrices with interval coefficients.",

    "summary": "K-nearest neighbor search is one of the fundamental tasks in various applications and the hierarchical navigable small world (HNSW) has recently drawn attention in large-scale cloud services, as it easily scales up the database while offering fast search. On the other hand, a computational storage device (CSD) that combines programmable logic and storage modules on a single board becomes popular to address the data bandwidth bottleneck of modern computing systems. In this paper, we propose a computational storage platform that can accelerate a large-scale graph-based nearest neighbor search algorithm based on SmartSSD CSD. To this end, we modify the algorithm more amenable on the hardware and implement two types of accelerators using HLS- and RTL-based methodology with various optimization methods. In addition, we scale up the proposed platform to have 4 SmartSSDs and apply graph parallelism to boost the system performance further. As a result, the proposed computational storage platform achieves 75.59 query per second throughput for the SIFT1B dataset at 258.66W power dissipation, which is 12.83x and 17.91x faster and 10.43x and 24.33x more energy efficient than the conventional CPU-based and GPU-based server platform, respectively. With multi-terabyte storage and custom acceleration capability, we believe that the proposed computational storage platform is a promising solution for cost-sensitive cloud datacenters.",

    "summary": "In mobile edge computing (MEC), one of the important challenges is how much resources of which mobile edge server (MES) should be allocated to which user equipment (UE). The existing resource allocation schemes only consider CPU as the requested resource and assume utility for MESs as either a random variable or dependent on the requested CPU only. This paper presents a novel comprehensive utility function for resource allocation in MEC. The utility function considers the heterogeneous nature of applications that a UE offloads to MES. The proposed utility function considers all important parameters, including CPU, RAM, hard disk space, required time, and distance, to calculate a more realistic utility value for MESs. Moreover, we improve upon some general algorithms, used for resource allocation in MEC and cloud computing, by considering our proposed utility function. We name the improved versions of these resource allocation schemes as comprehensive resource allocation schemes. The UE requests are modeled to represent the amount of resources requested by the UE as well as the time for which the UE has requested these resources. The utility function depends upon the UE requests and the distance between UEs and MES, and serves as a realistic means of comparison between different types of UE requests. Choosing (or selecting) an optimal MES with the optimal amount of resources to be allocated to each UE request is a challenging task. We show that MES resource allocation is sub-optimal if CPU is the only resource considered. By taking into account the other resources, i.e., RAM, disk space, request time, and distance in the utility function, we demonstrate improvement in the resource allocation algorithms in terms of service rate, utility, and MES energy consumption.",

    "summary": "Edge Computing in 5G and Beyond is a promising solution for ultra-low latency applications (e.g. Autonomous Vehicle, Augmented Reality, and Remote Surgery), which have an extraordinarily low tolerance for the delay and require fast data processing for a very high volume of data. The requirements of delay-sensitive applications (e.g. Low latency, proximity, and Location/Context-awareness) cannot be satisfied by Cloud Computing due to the high latency between User Equipment and Cloud. Nevertheless, Edge Computing in 5G and beyond can promise an ultra-high-speed caused by placing computation capabilities closer to endpoint devices, whereas 5G encourages the speed rate that is 200 times faster than 4G LTE-Advanced. This paper deeply investigates Edge Computing in 5G and characterizes it based on the requirements of ultra-low latency applications. As a contribution, we propose a hybrid architecture that takes advantage of novel and sustainable technologies (e.g. D2D communication, Massive MIMO, SDN, and NFV) and has major features such as scalability, reliability and ultra-low latency support. The proposed architecture is evaluated based on an agent-based simulation that demonstrates it can satisfy requirements and has the ability to respond to high volume demands with low latency.",

    "summary": "Recent epidemiological studies have hypothesized that the prevalence of cortical cataracts is closely related to ultraviolet radiation. However, the prevalence of nuclear cataracts is higher in elderly people in tropical areas than in temperate areas. The dominant factors inducing nuclear cataracts have been widely debated. In this study, the temperature increase in the lens due to exposure to ambient conditions was computationally quantified in subjects of 50-60 years of age in tropical and temperate areas, accounting for differences in thermoregulation. A thermoregulatory response model was extended to consider elderly people in tropical areas. The time course of lens temperature for different weather conditions in five cities in Asia was computed. The temperature was higher around the mid and posterior part of the lens, which coincides with the position of the nuclear cataract. The duration of higher temperatures in the lens varied, although the daily maximum temperatures were comparable. A strong correlation (adjusted R2 > 0.85) was observed between the prevalence of nuclear cataract and the computed cumulative thermal dose in the lens. We propose the use of a cumulative thermal dose to assess the prevalence of nuclear cataracts. Cumulative wet-bulb globe temperature, a new metric computed from weather data, would be useful for practical assessment in different cities.",
