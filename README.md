### Get Open AI Account and API Keys
- Signup for Open AI to get an API Key.

- Generate the API Key, keep it safe not in GitHub but somewhere safe. It will appear only once and cannot be recovered.

## Setup empty GitHub repository
- Create an empty repository.
- My choice of language is Python, so picked the Python as the primary language while setting up the repo.
