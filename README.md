# OpenAIExperiments
Exploring ChatGPT, Open AI APIs

## Exploration Setup Steps

### Get Open AI Account and API Keys
- Signup for Open AI to get an API Key.
- Setup an account first [Open AI API Key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) 
- Generate the API Key, keep it safe not in GitHub but somewhere safe. It will appear only once and cannot be recovered.
- As a free account you have $18 credit by default. See usage here [Usage](https://beta.openai.com/account/usage)

## Setup empty GitHub repository
- Create an empty repository.
- My choice of language is Python, so picked the Python as the primary language while setting up the repo.

## Setup GitHub CodeSpaces to do local development
- Without the hassle of local setup, you can get a devlopment environment interacting with your repository.
- Read more about CodeSpaces [here](https://github.com/codespaces)
- 1 min tutorial to get setup see this [video](https://youtu.be/_W9B7qc9lVc)
- Note - As of Jan 2023 I read there is 15GB and 120 Core Hours of Free Use per month on personal account. Please review [here](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#monthly-included-storage-and-core-hours-for-personal-accounts)
- If you have a day job and can only spend daily 30 mins on weekdays and 4 to 5 hours per weekend, the hours cover more than enough for self learning pace.(It will be less than 50 hours per month of use, hence the conclusion.)
